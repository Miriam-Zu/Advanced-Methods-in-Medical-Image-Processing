# Advanced-Methods-in-Medical-Image-Processing
Final Project

Right now the data is divided into 2 folders for use of the binary alexnet.

The binary alexnet's path is 01_binary.

Note: the 2 folders are 01_binary and 23_binary.

Each folder contains a train folder and a test folder with the appropriate files.

In order to run the script on other binary combinations, you must order the folders in the correct fashion and change the path in the script accordingly.

In order to run the perceptron, you must put all train folders together under a folder "train" and all test folders together under a folder "test". The way it is set up now, divided in to binary folders, will not work!
